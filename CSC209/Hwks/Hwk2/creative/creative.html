    <h3>Some Information</h3>
    <p><span id="hide"></span><span id="more">Once again, I'm not the most creative so I decided to use the same format from technical in my creative part. I've decided to make it varying shades of green to match the Pusheen header (by the way, all images on this webpage were taken from the internet). I also included a little about me section to practice some other features I learned from the tutorials, such as an animated accordion-style feature with a few fun facts about me, like my favorite artists, my plans for the summer, and my hobbies!</accordion-style>. </span></p>

    <h2>More About Me!</h2>
    <button class="accordion">My Hobbies</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Lately I haven’t had much time to do my hobbies because of school and work and the like. But usually I’m a big reader, like a BIG reader. I think one year I managed to read 50 books in total, but that was definitely a couple years ago. Last year I didn’t even make it to 20 books, but I digress. I also love to bake! On my public Instagram page, I have an entire highlight dedicated to my baked goods (and my dog is in most of the pictures, haha). Unfortunately, because smith doesn’t really have too many usable kitchens (especially in Duckett house, which is my house) so I’m never able to bake on campus, but when I go back home I bake a ton! </p>

    <button class="accordion">My Favorite Artists at the Moment!</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>I’ll admit, my taste in music isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but lately my music taste has definitely gotten better (trust me). I used to listen to a lot of Taylor Swift, like she was my most listened to artist for a solid three years. But lately I’ve been listening to a lot of Chappell Roan (I LOVE Chappell Roan), Kendrick Lamar (I have the Super Bowl halftime show linked in the navigation bar), Sabrina Carpenter (nothing new there), and 6arelyhuman (pronounced Barely Human)! I have some songs from different artists on rotation as well, such as Headlock by Imogen Heap, VVV (HES BACK) by mikeeysmind, and Love Potions by BJ Lips. </p>
